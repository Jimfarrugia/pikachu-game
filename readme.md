A simple game inspired by the offline chrome dinosaur game.

The pokemon in the foreground are animated using CSS sprites. Original images can be found in `img` folder.

### Issues:

- Pidgey should respawn properly when it reaches the left edge of the background.
- The start button, animation durations and gameContainer size should be sized responsively.
